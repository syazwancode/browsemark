        <p>
          Sprucemarks has been available for free since 2011. The free model was
          great to start with, but it limits the amount of features,
          improvements, and support I can offer.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's why Sprucemarks will become
          <a
            href="https://www.patreon.com/nightmode/posts"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Patreon</a
          >
          supported software as early as January 1, 2020. Your Patreon support
          will allow me to work on the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Refactor with modern JavaScript.</li>
          <li>Better sorting for multilingual characters.</li>
          <li>New extension name, graphics, and options screen.</li>
          <li>User customizable logic for custom sorting rules.</li>
          <li>Possible Firefox compatibility.</li>
          <li>Support tools, documentation, videos, and more.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Once the Patreon changes are live, you'll be able to access
          Sprucemarks for as little as $1 a month, or unlock Sprucemarks ongoing
          once you donate $7 or more.
        </p>

        <p>
          For anyone not interested in becoming a Patreon, you may want to make
          a copy of the
          <a

            rel="noopener"
            >current version of Sprucemarks</a
          >
          before January 1, 2020. Use the current version for personal use or
          even as the basis of your own extension. Just make sure to not use the
          word "Sprucemarks" or any of the images included as they are strictly
          copyrighted to Kai Nightmode.
